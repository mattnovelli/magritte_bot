# magritte_bot
A Twitter bot that spits out randomly generated parodies of The Treachery of Images

To get started with making this bot, you need to install a few libraries and get your twitter API keys first.


# API KEYS
1. Go to https://developer.twitter.com/
2. Log in with the twitter account you'd like to use.
3. Go through the steps and fill out the forms to create your first "app."
4. Go to details > Keys and tokens > and copy the generated keys to the bot.py key fields (at the top!).
----------------------

# INSTALLING LIBRARIES

Libraries required for the bot:
  - Tweepy (https://www.tweepy.org)
  - google-images-download (https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download)
  - Pillow (https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)
----------------------

Edit the words in the words.py file to your heart's content :)

If you'd like to automate the bot, consider running a crontab on a raspberry pi (that's what I do)

<b>Happy Botting!</b>
