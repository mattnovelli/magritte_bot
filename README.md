# magritte_bot
**magritte_bot** was a Twitter bot that generated and Tweeted random versions of Ren√© Magritte's 1929 painting [The Treachery of Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images). The bot picks a random noun from a list and downloads the first square PNG Google Images result. Using the [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) and [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) libraries, the image is assembled and spit out on Twitter. The bot is written in Python and tweeted twice a day per a [cronjob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) on a Raspberry Pi in my dorm.
